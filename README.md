# HSA Code Generator
This repository contains Python code that implements three distinct classesâ€” 'PackagePath', 'LicensePath', and 'DependencyPath'. These classes are designed to facilitate the generation of specific file paths for the deployment of a Hardware Support App (HSA). The graphical user interface (GUI) implemented in the code enables users to input component names, driver names, package file names, license file names, and dependency package paths.

# Classes:
PackagePath:
Constructor initializes the object with component, driver, and package attributes.
Accessor methods (component, driver, packagepath) retrieve the respective attribute values.

LicensePath:
Constructor initializes the object with component, driver, and license attributes.
Accessor methods (component, driver, licensepath) retrieve the respective attribute values.

DependencyPath:
Constructor initializes the object with component, driver, and dependency attributes.
Accessor methods (component, driver, dependencypath) retrieve the respective attribute values.
The __str__ method generates a formatted string representing the dependency package path.

# Graphical User Interface (GUI):
The code also includes a GUI implemented using the **tkinter** library. The GUI, named hsaGUI_Grid, allows users to input essential parameters such as component names, driver names, package file names, license file names, and dependency package paths. It features labeled entry fields, a scrolled text output area, and buttons for generating, copying, and clearing the generated code.

Usage:
To use the code:

1. Run the code and the GUI will pop up.
2. Input the required parameters in the GUI.
3. Click the "Generate Code" button to generate the corresponding file path code.
4. Optionally, click the "Copy Code" button to copy the generated code to the clipboard.
5. Click the "Clear All" button to reset the input fields and generated code area.

Feel free to explore and adapt this code for your specific needs!
